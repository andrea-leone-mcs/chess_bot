# chess_bot
## Brief Description
In this repository I'm storing my personal implementation of a chess bot.
This project is done just for fun (I enjoy chess & programming, so why not doing something which relates them?) without the intention of replacing any current chess bot or chess-programming best practice.
The goals of this project are:
- Practicing with Rust language;
- Being able to develop a GUI application written in Rust using the **gtk4** library.;
- Enhancing problem solving skills by facing challenging problems which will naturally come up while programming a chess bot.
